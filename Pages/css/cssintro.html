                        <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
                        <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a document.</p>
                        <p>HTML was intended to <strong>define the content</strong> of a document, like:</p>
                        <p>&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
                        <p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
                        <p>When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 
specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large 
web sites, where fonts and color information were added to every single  
page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
                        <p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
                        <p>In HTML 4.0, all formatting could (and should!) be removed from the HTML document, and stored 
in a separate CSS file.</p>
                        <h2>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2>
                        <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
                        <p>With an external style sheet file, you can change the look of an entire Web 
site by changing just one file!</p>
